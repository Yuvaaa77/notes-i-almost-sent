    <section class="intro-card">
      <p>
        This started quietly. Not as a confession, not as a plan —
        but as a place to hold thoughts that kept returning.
        Some days it was just one line, some days it was too much
        to fit into words. I didn’t want to send them.
        I didn’t want to forget them either.
        So I kept them here — one day at a time.
