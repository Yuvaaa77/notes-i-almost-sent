      <p class="description">
        This started quietly. Not as a confession, not as a plan — but as a place to
        hold thoughts that kept returning. Some days it was just one line, some days
        it was too much to fit into words. I didn’t want to send them. I didn’t want
        to forget them either. So I kept them here — one day at a time.
