      <p>
        This started quietly. Not as a confession, not as a plan —
        but as a place to hold thoughts that kept returning.
        Some days it was just one line, some days it was too much to fit into words.
        I didn’t want to send them. I didn’t want to forget them either.
        So I kept them here — one day at a time.
